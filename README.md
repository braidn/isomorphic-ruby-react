# README

Contained within Docker (just run `docker-compose up`).

This is just a small exploration project to check out 
Opal + React + Rails written 100 percent in Ruby. 

## The Point

Get a good feeling on how to write front-end and back-end 
applications ONLY using a single language. The idea is to 
minimize ALL of the context switching that is involved when 
writing a Rails app married to Coffeescript and or JS.

Is it possible?
How Well does it work?
